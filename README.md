## Repo for Developing GNN algorithms for tracklet finding in the pixel detector (for CMS or ATLAS)

This code uses data from the CERN [Track ML Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification/overview) which can be downloaded from Kaggle. This repository includes the python library to easily read the data into a dataframe in the `trackml-library` folder. Upon first downloading this repository you must install this library by running 
``` pip install /path/to/repository```
